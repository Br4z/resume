# Resume

Feel free to fork this repository or use it as a template for your own resume. Just edit the `main.tex` file with your information, update the `picture.jpg` and compile it with a LaTeX editor.

If you have any publications, add them to the `publications.pub` file and uncomment the `\section{Referencias}` line in the main `.tex` file.
